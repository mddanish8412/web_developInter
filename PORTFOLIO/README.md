# Project: Responsive Portfolio Website

This project is a solution for a web development challenge to create a fully responsive, single-page website layout. The website serves as a personal portfolio for a web developer.

# Design Choices

# 1. Theme
The chosen theme is a **Modern & Clean Web Developer Portfolio**. The goal was to create a professional and visually appealing layout that is easy to navigate and highlights key information about the developer.

# 2. Color Scheme
A dark-mode theme was selected for a modern and focused look.
- **Primary Background:** `#1a1a2e` (Dark Charcoal)
- **Secondary Background/Cards:** `#16213e` (Navy)
- **Accent Color:** `#00f5c8` (Bright Cyan/Teal for buttons, links, and highlights)
- **Text Color:** `#e3e3e3` (Off-White for readability)

# 3. Typography
Two fonts were chosen from Google Fonts for a clean and balanced typographic hierarchy:
- **Headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`):** `Poppins` - A modern, geometric sans-serif font.
- **Body Text (`p`):** `Roboto` - A highly readable and neutral sans-serif font.

# 4. Layout
The layout is structured with semantic HTML5 for clarity and accessibility. Flexbox and CSS Grid are used to create responsive and flexible component arrangements.
